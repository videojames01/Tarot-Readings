# Tarot-Readings
Like a Tarot card reading, but via computer.

I don't actually believe in Tarot readings or anything, I just wanted to try something a little more complicated than rock-paper-scissors, or whatever.

TarotReading.py is the main script, TarotCards.py is just a module (I hope I used those words right haha)
